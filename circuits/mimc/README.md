MiMC cipher and hash function
-----------------------------

MiMC-p/p and MiMC-2p/p block ciphers and permutations; and MiMC-Feistel-2p/p hash 
function. The implementation is specialized to the BN254 (alt-bn-128) curve's 
scalar field  (the default field in `circom`):

    p = 21888242871839275222246405745257275088548364400416034343698204186575808495617

We use the parameters: exponent `d=5` and `r=ceil(log2(p)/log2(d))=110` rounds
for MiMC-p/p, and `2*r=220` rounds for MiMC-2p/p (Feistel mode)

The round constants are generated by the following algorithm:

- take the largest prefix of the digits of pi=3.1415.., interpreted as an integer,
  which is less than `2^256`. Call this `seed`.
- let the i-th round constant, starting from i=0, be the SHA256 hash `H(seed|i) mod p`
  where both `seed` and `i` and the hash are interpreted as a 256-bit little-endian 
  numbers.

For reference,

    seed = 31415926535897932384626433832795028841971693993751058209749445923078164062862
